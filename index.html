				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<p> Hi, Im Tasha. I am a currently a student at the Univeristy of Texas Coding Academy. I have a many hobbies which are include but are not limited to the following: Skating, Hiking, Fishing. I also foster kittens every now and then. I am very excited to learn more about the webdevelopement world. Please feel free to check out my profile with my current work. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p> When it comes to coding, I'd have to say my favorite language thus far is JavaScript. I really like manipulating components of a webpage and figuring out new and interesting effects. I also really enjoying using JQuery. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>Before I started web developement, I studyed bioengineering, at Binghamton Unviersty. Shortly after that I got a position as a clinical engineering manager and floated around the US sitting at hospitals that did'nt have any managers. I found this was not the best fit for me so I settled in Austin and became a Data Analyst for a Digital Advertising Company. I found that all too often I would work with AdWords Scripts. This got me interested in JavaScript and thus started this path.
